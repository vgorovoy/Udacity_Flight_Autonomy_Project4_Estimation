# Velocity control gains
# kpVelXY = 10 # if we make it smaller (2) it will oscilate a lot but on the right track, if we increase it too much (40) it will go completely off path
# kpVelZ = 10 # if we make it smaller (2) it will oscilate a lot, if we we increase it it too high (100) it will have more problems following the trajectory

# Angle control gains
kpBank = 15 # decreasing (5) will create more oscillations before you become parallel, increasing too much (100) will cause rotating across acess and lose control, decreasing to 10 will optimize settle time for normal quadrotors, but it will stop working for quadrotor with changed center of mass
kpYaw = 2  # decreasing to 1 will not allow to change yaw to commanded position fast enough, increasing too much (10) will cause instability

# Angle rate gains
kpPQR = 60, 60, 5 # decreasing too much will cause instability (20,20,5), increasing too much will have troubles following the trajectory (200,200,20), 90, 90, 5 alsow works, but trajectory seems to be better with 60,60,5
